# CS7012 Management Of Networks & Distributed Systems (Group Project)

Managing MapReduce with SNMP.

Currently using Python 2.7 with PySNMP library & Mininet for managing virtual instances.

## Quick-Start

Follow guides on http://www.it-slav.net/blogs/2009/02/05/install-and-configure-snmp-on-ubuntu/ and https://kspviswa.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/how-to-run-snmp-agents-clients-inside-mininet-hosts/ to setup SNMPd with Mininet on the Mininet VM (see second link for VM downloads).

Install python-pysnmp4 and snmpd using apt-get on the Mininet VM.

Clone this Git repository into a folder and CD into it. Then you can run "sudo python ./snmpTest.py" to check if SNMP runs in the Mininet VM.
